# S-LinkedIn
A LinkedIn ripoff, for recruiters and applicants

The symbol **S** stands for **hope** on Superman's planet.

It stands for **~~shit~~ speed** on my website.

Directory Structure:
- Data: stores fake data used for testing
- backend
- frontend

Basic instructions:
- ```node_modules``` folders have been removed, for saving on space
- both backend and frontend folders have package.json files
- cd into each directory parallely, and run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies
- run ```npm start``` for both, to start the website!
